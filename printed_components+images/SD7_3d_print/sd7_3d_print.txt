With the stepper motor attachment there was a cylinder attached to another smaller cylinder that was to be connected to the driving shaft of the motor. Additionally there was a concavity made with a prism that was added to the smaller cylinder to make a hole for the motor. Last operation was with the hole in the stepper motor holder. This was made with one rectangular prism and then taking away a cylinder and prism from the main prism. I received measurements of the motor from the online datasheet.
